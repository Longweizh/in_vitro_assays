## Quantification Pipeline of Fluorescent Cells within in vitro images

This pipeline can be used to perform analysis and quantification on images of in vitro images to determine how many fluorescent cells are present as a fraction of the total number of cells stained with DAPI. The median brightness of those cells can subsequently be determined.

## Motivation

Quantification of in vitro transduction requires robust and reproducible pipelines. Due to significant variability in the DAPI signal in our images, a workflow to convert brightfield and signal images into masks was created.

## Workflow

1. Convert brightfield and signal images into masks using the GrandinaruLab cellseg package.
2. Perform quantification of the number of cells and their median brightness using the generated masks.
3. Perform statistical analysis and visualization of the results.
